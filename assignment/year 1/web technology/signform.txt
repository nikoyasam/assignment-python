Sure! Here's a detailed explanation of how the functionality of the code works:

The HTML code defines a sign-up form that is split into two pages using the div with id="subpage1". The form is submitted using the "submit" button in each page, which is captured using the querySelector method.

The JavaScript code defines four variables:

signupForm - this variable captures the entire sign-up form using the getElementById method.

subpage1Form - this variable captures the subpage1 form using the getElementById method.

nextBtn1 - this variable captures the "next" button on the first page using the querySelector method.

nextBtn2 - this variable captures the "next" button on the second page using the querySelector method.

The code then defines two more variables to capture the two pages of the form:

page1 - this variable captures the first page of the form using the getElementById method.

page2 - this variable captures the second page of the form using the getElementById method.

The code then adds an event listener to the "submit" button on the first page of the form. When the user clicks this button, the event listener prevents the default form submission behavior and instead hides the first page of the form using the "display:none" CSS property and shows the second page of the form using the "display:block" CSS property.

The same process is repeated for the second page of the form. When the user clicks the "submit" button on the second page, the event listener prevents the default form submission behavior and instead logs the form data to the console (in this case, it just uses console.log to print the form data).

Finally, the code includes a "login" link that is shown on both pages of the form. When the user clicks this link, it takes them to the login page. This link is simply an anchor tag with an href attribute that points to the login page.

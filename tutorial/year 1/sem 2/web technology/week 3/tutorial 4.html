            <h1>How AI becomes an industry</h1>
            <h2>(1908-1980)</h2>
            <div><p id = "para1">The first successful commercial expert system, Rl, began operation at Digital Equipment Corporation (McDermott, 1982). The program helped configure orders for new computer systems, and by 1986, it was saving the company an estimated $40 million a year. By 1988, DEC's AI group had 40 deployed expert systems, with more on the way. Du Pont had 100 in use and 500 in development, saving an estimated $10 million a year. Nearly every major U.S. corporation had its own AI group and was either using or investigating expert system technology. In 1981, the Japanese announced the "Fifth Generation" project, a 10-year plan to build intelligent computers running Prolog in much the same way that ordinary computers run machine code. The idea was that with the ability to make millions of inferences per second, computers would be able to take advantage of vast stores of rules. The project proposed to achieve full-scale natural language understanding, among other ambitious goals.The Fifth Generation project fueled interest in AI, and by taking advantage of fears of Japanese domination, researchers and corporations were able to generate support for a similar investment in the United States. The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation i(MCC) was formed as a research consortium to counter the Japanese project. In Britain, the Alvey report reinstated the funding that was cut by the Lighthill report.In both cases, AI waspart of a broad effort, including chip design and human-interface research.</p></div>

            <div><p id="para2">The booming AI industry also included companies such as Carnegie Group, Inference,Intellicorp, and Teknowledge that offered the software tools to build expert systems, and hardware companies such as Lisp Machines Inc., Texas Instruments, Symbolics, and Xerox that; were building workstations optimized for the development of Lisp programs. Over a hundred companies built industrial robotic vision systems. Overall, the industry went from a few million \ in sales in 1980 to $2 billion in 1988.</div>

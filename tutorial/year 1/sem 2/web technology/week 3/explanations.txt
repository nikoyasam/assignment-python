13.a)The <nav> element is used to specify a navigation bar on a web page. It provides a way to group together 
     links to important pages or sections of the website, making it easier for users to <navigate class="


13.b)The # in the href attribute is a fragment identifier, used to indicate that the link is to an internal location on the same page, 
     rather than a different page. In this case, the #home refers to an element with an id attribute of "home", and clicking the "Home" link 
     in the navigation bar will take the user to that element on the page.


17)a)li a selector will match all the a elements that are contained within the li elements in the navigation bar. 
     This allows you to apply specific styles to the a elements within the li elements, which in turn makes it easier to style 
     the navigation bar.

   b)Yes, the descendant selector nav a would select all the a elements that are descendants of the nav element.

   c)The selector "a" will select all the "a" elements in the HTML document, regardless of where they are located in the document tree. 
     So if you use only "a", all the hyperlinks in the document will be selected.
